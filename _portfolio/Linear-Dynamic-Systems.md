In this project I used empirically-obtained lab data to construct four different models of a system, each with a different number of states (n<sub>s</sub> = 6, 7, 10, 20). 

Proceeding with an identified model of sufficient accuracy and efficiency, n<sub>s</sub> = 7, the following tasks were completed:
- Identify the transmission zeros of the MIMO model and zeros of each channel
- Construct a block diagram from analysis of the individual channels
- Impulse response identification from white noise inputs
- H<sub>2</sub> norm analysis of the identified model
- H<sub>âˆž</sub> norm analysis of the identified model
