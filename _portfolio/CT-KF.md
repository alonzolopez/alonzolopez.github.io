# Problem Statement
For UCLA's MAE 271B final project, I implemented an online missile state estimation algorithm that estimates a missile's position, velocity, and acceleration relative to a moving target. This is the first half of the rendezvous problem: the state estimation. The second half, the control, was not part of the project scope, so in the plots below you'll see that the relative position between the missile and target does not go to zero (i.e. the missile does not hit the target). However, the filter performs well and is able to track the relative states between the missile and target accurately. Here are the position, velocity, acceleration, and sensor measurement plots for one run of the target tracking scenario.

  <figcaption>The true sensor measurement (Theta) and the unfiltered sensor measurment observed by the missile (Z). Theta is generated by Equation (3) from the paper. The angle blows up to infinity as the time-to-go approaches zero due to the structure of Equation (3). While Theta and Z look identical at the initial plot resolution, zooming into the low magnitude values of Z in the 10 - 2 second range, you'll see the noise in Z. Z is corrupted by fading and scintillation noise described in Equation (4) in the paper. </figcaption>

# Monte Carlo Simulation
To further verify the performance of the filter, a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 realizations was performed. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in position, velocity, and acceleration were compared with the a priori covariance values computed by the filter. The figures below show that the actual RMSE plots in the three states match the precomputed values, thus verifying the filter's performance for the Gauss-Markov model.

<!-- # Filter Robustness
In order to test the filter's robustness, the Monte Carlo simulation was run again but with a different process noise model. The process dynamics of the Gauss-Markov model for which it was designed were replaced by the dynamics associated with the Telegraph noise model described in Equation (13). 

The filter is shown to handle the Telegraph noise model and associated process dynamics well, as shown by the state estimation results for one run below:
